To infer information about Java code we use two existing inference tools and 
an exception inference developed by ourselves and combine their output. 
Too aid in writing our own analyses, we have additionally developed a simple 
framework. 

To combine the results of disparate analyses we have to convert their results
into a common format.  We use the JAIF~\cite{JAIF}
(Java Annotation Index File) format for that purpose.  Some anaylses generate
results directly in JAIF format, some provide annotated bytecodes which can be
easily extracted into JAIF format, and others provide textual results for which
we will read the results into a our framework.

Figure~\ref{fig:from_source_to_jaif} 
illustrates the stages from the source to JAIF in our toolchain, explained 
below. While figure~\ref{fig:from_jaif_to_javadoc} shows how JavaGrok
puts the annotations back into the source files and generates the HTML
documentation.

In a first step Uno processes the source code to annotate. 
Because Uno stores its inferred properties in a single separate file, 
we changed UNO's output format slightly.
To integrate the analysis results into the Java documentation we
use our own framework. We implemented a tree visitor inside the Java 7 
compiler that, at initialization, reads in the file generated by UNO and 
stores the information in a hashset. During the iteration over the AST
our visitor inserts annotation at the appropriate places. These then
get extracted into files in the JAIF format.

% TODO: has to move into section 3: analysis
To infer exception annotation we use the Annotation Processing Tool (APT)
API~\cite{apt} built into the Java standard compiler.
% TODO: We will likely switch to also use the Type Annotation Processor! But not
% yet
From within an APT plugin
we can access the compiler's abstract syntax tree and augment the generated
bytecode with annotations representing our analysis results. These annotations
are then extracted into external annotation files.

Javarifier produces its results directly in the JAIF format which allows to
easily integrate it into the toolchain.

Once the results of the various analyses have been collected into a set of
annotation files, the annotation file utilities~\cite{AFU} merge
those annotations back into the original library source. The annotated source
code is now one of the output formats. Additionally Javadoc also extracts 
these annotations and puts them into the html documentation.
