\section{Conclusion}

The results of our user evaluation were inconclusive.  We did not reach any reliable conclusion on whether javagrok annotations are helpful to programmers in practice.  There are a number of possible reasons our study was ineffective.

First and most significantly, we found it very difficult to pick a suitable task.  We rejected many tasks because they were too simple.  These tasks did not frustrate users and appeared unlikely to benefit from any form of documentation.  On the other hand, the tasks we did choose were frustrating, but primarily due to a lack of informal, high level documentation.  The formal properties that javagrok inferred proved to be mostly irrelevant.

When we began this project, we chose to find and use pre-existing analyses in order to save time.  In hindsight, this was a questionable choice.  The analyses were surprisingly difficult to get working and integrated together.  Once the analyses were integrated and ran, we found that the results were somewhat ill-suited to our documentation purposes. (e.g. the lack of \texttt{@Nullable} annotations noted by one of our test subjects) We now believe that creating analyses tailored to documentation generation is a more promising and effective approach.

None the less, many test subjects thought the generated annotations would be useful.  This leads us to believe that the principal failing of our experimental design was a poor task.  A better task could take two forms.  A more carefully selected or specially engineered task could be used to test the negative hypothesis:  Automatically generated documentation annotations are not useful in a wide variety of situations and tasks.  If JavaGrok fails to help users understand optimistically selected use-cases, we can conclude that it is unlikely to help users at all.  However, demonstrating the positive hypothesis will likely be more difficult.  For realistic programming tasks the annotations may only be useful once in every fifty times a developer refers to the documentation.  For this reason we believe that a longer a longer in-situ industrial study is necessary to provide meaningful positive conclusions.
