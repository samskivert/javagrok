% \section{Conclusion}

\section{Division of Labor}

Michael is developing the basic toolchain, integrating the mutability analysis
and documenting the evaluation process. Colin set up the \LaTeX~report
structure, is integrating the exception documentation analysis and documenting
the broader related work. Reto is integrating the leaking and capturing
analysis and documenting the main technical approach. Gilbert is integrating
the nullability analysis and handling introductions and conclusions. If
existing tools for exception documentation, leaking and capturing, and
nullability cannot be obtained or usefully integrated, the respective parties
may reimplement the analyses using a simple framework Michael developed using
\texttt{javac}'s plugin API.  The evaluation itself, both the exemplar
comparison and the user study will be load balanced as evenly as possible across
all members, depending on scheduling issues.
