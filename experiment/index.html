<h2>JavaGrok Experiment</h2>

<p> Hello! Thanks for participating in this experimental evaluation of our
JavaGrok tool. We've provided these instructions to give you a bit of
background and guide you through the programming tasks we'd like you to
complete. </p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p> JavaGrok is a tool that enhances Java source code with the results of a
  variety of program analyses in hopes of giving you useful additional
  information on how to use code with which you may not be familiar. </p>

<p> The enhancements to the source take the form of annotations added to
  methods and parameters. Each annotation communicates some property about the
  method in question. The exact set of annotations added by JavaGrok is
  described below, but first we'll give you a concrete example. </p>

<h3>Annotation Example</h3>

<p> The following is an example of a method augmented by JavaGrok
  annotations: </p>

<blockquote>
<hr>
<pre>
    @UniqueReturn
    public List parse () throws ParseException
    {
        // ...
    }
</pre>
<hr>
</blockquote>

<p> This method has the <code>@UniqueReturn</code> property which indicates
  that the object returned by the method is not retained by the object on which
  the method was called and is under the total control of the caller. In this
  case, we can interpret that to mean that the <code>List</code> returned
  by <code>parse()</code> is newly created and it is safe for the caller to
  mutate it if needed. </p>

<h3>Annotations</h3>

<p> The full set of annotations that may be provided by JavaGrok are enumerated
  below, along with an explanation of the meaning of the annotation. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>@UniqueReturn</strong><br /> Occurs on method declarations.
  Indicates that the return value is a unique reference to its referent.</li>

<li><strong>@NonUniqueReturn</strong><br /> Occurs on method declarations.
  Contrairiwise indicates that the return value is not the only reference
  existing to the referent.</li>

<li><strong>@Retained</strong><br /> Occurs on method parameters. Indicates
  that this method (or one of its overriding methods in a subclass) retains the
  reference in at least one possible path. If the reference you supplied was a
  unique reference, it may not be unique afterwards.</li>

<li><strong>@NotRetained</strong><br /> Occurs on method parameters. Indicates
  that this method (or one of its overriding methods in a subclass) does
  <strong>not</strong> retain the reference along any path.  If you supply a
  unique reference, the uniqueness of the reference will be preserved.</li>

<li><strong>@NonNull</strong><br /> Occurs on method parameters and return
  values.  In the case of a method parameter, indicates that null must not be
  passed in that parameter. In the case of a return value, indicates that the
  method will not return null.</li>

<li><strong>@Throws</strong><br /> Occurs on method declarations. Indicates
  exceptions thrown by the method and the conditions under which they are
  thrown.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Experiment Procedure</h3>

<p> Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to extend a simple Lisp
  interpreter (written in Java) with additional built-in functions. We have
  provided source code the interpreter (augmented by JavaGrok) as well as
  English language descriptions of the tasks you are to perform. You will
  likely need to refer to the existing interpreter source code to correctly
  complete these tasks. </p>

<p><b>Checklist</b><br/> We have also provided a checklist on which we request
  that you record your experiences while completing these programming tasks.
  The checklist is meant to give us some quantitative feedback on how
  frequently you find the annotations to be useful, as well as how frequently
  you find that you need to carefully read the interpreter source code because
  the annotations do not provide sufficient information. Please try to update
  the checklist as you proceed through the tasks. </p>

<p> <a href="checklist.html">Checklist</a> (You will probably find it helpful to
  print out the checklist so that you can write on it during the experiment.)

<h3>Tasks and Build System</h3>

<p><b>Task Source Files</b><br/> Each task has an associated source file in
  which the code for that task should be placed. The tasks are ordered in a way
  that we think makes them easiest to complete, but you may complete them out
  of order if you prefer: </p>

<blockquote><pre>
src/uclisp/Bmin.java
src/uclisp/Bcons.java
src/uclisp/Bcar.java
src/uclisp/Bcdr.java
</pre></blockquote>

<p><b>Build System</b><br/> A build system has been provided for compiling and
  running the tasks. The ant build tool is used to compile and run the tasks. A
  separate target exists to compile and run each task. If you invoke the build
  system from the command line, you would do so as follows: </p>

<blockquote><pre>
% ant min
% ant cons
% ant car
% ant cdr
</pre></blockquote>

<p> You may opt instead to use a development environment such as
  Eclipse. <code>.project</code> and <code>.classpath</code> files have been
  provided that should allow you to simply import the experiment directory
  directly into Eclipse and write and execute the tasks from there.  Using any
  other IDE is also fine. </p>

<p><b>Javadoc documentation</b><br/> The Javadoc documentation for the
interpreter is available here: </p>

<p><a href="docs/index.html">Library documentation</a></p>

<p> None of the code has been documented using Javadoc document comments, so
  this is probably only useful if you wish to see all of the classes and
  methods at a glance, rather than inspecting the source code directly or using
  your IDE. </p>

<h3>Submitting Results</h3>

To submit your findings we provide a checklist which you should have received
as a printed copy! Also please be sure to fill out
the <a href="questionnaire.html">post-experiment questionairre</a> a copy of
which you should also have received.
