<h2>JavaGrok Experiment</h2>

<p> Hello! Thanks for participating in this experimental evaluation of our
JavaGrok tool. We've provided these instructions to give you a bit of
background and guide you through the programming tasks we'd like you to
complete. </p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p> JavaGrok is a tool that enhances Javadoc documentation with the results of
  a variety of program analyses in hopes of giving you useful additional
  information on how to use a library with which you may not be familiar. </p>

<p> The enhancements to the Javadoc take the form of annotations added to the
  method documentation. Each annotation communicates some property about the
  method in question. The exact set of annotations added by JavaGrok is
  described below, but first we'll give you a concrete example. </p>

<h3>Annotation Example</h3>

<p> The following is an example of a method augmented by JavaGrok
  annotations: </p>

<blockquote>
<hr>
<h3>getViewBounds</h3>
<pre><font size="-1">@NonUniqueReturn</font>
public Rectangle <strong>getViewBounds</strong>()</pre>
<dl>
<dd>Get the bounds of the viewport, in media coordinates. For the base
 MediaPanel, this will always be (0, 0, width, height).</dd>
</dl>
<hr>
</blockquote>

<p> This method has the <code>@NonUniqueReturn</code> property which indicates
  that a reference to the object returned by the method is retained by the
  object on which the method was called. In this case, we can interpret that to
  mean that the <code>Rectangle</code> returned by <code>getViewBounds()</code>
  has not been defensively copied and as a result should probably not be
  modified by the caller. </p>

<h3>Annotations</h3>

<p> The full set of annotations that may be provided by JavaGrok are enumerated
  below, along with an explanation of the meaning of the annotation. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>@UniqueReturn</strong><br /> Occurs on method declarations.
  Indicates that the return value is a unique reference to its referent.</li>

<li><strong>@NonUniqueReturn</strong><br /> Occurs on method declarations.
  Contrariwise indicates that the return value is not the only reference
  existing to the referent.</li>

<li><strong>@Retained</strong><br /> Occurs on method parameters. Indicates
  that this method (or one of its overriding methods in a subclass) retains the
  reference in at least one possible path. If the reference you supplied was a
  unique reference, it may not be unique afterwards.</li>

<li><strong>@NotRetained</strong><br /> Occurs on method parameters. Indicates
  that this method (or one of its overriding methods in a subclass) does
  <strong>not</strong> retain the reference along any path.  If you supply a
  unique reference, the uniqueness of the reference will be preserved.</li>

<li><strong>@NonNull</strong><br /> Occurs on method parameters and return
  values.  In the case of a method parameter, indicates that null must not be
  passed in that parameter. In the case of a return value, indicates that the
  method will not return null.</li>

<li><strong>@Throws</strong><br /> Occurs on method declarations. Indicates
  exceptions thrown by the method and the conditions under which they are
  thrown.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Experiment Procedure</h3>

<p> Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to complete a series of
  programming tasks that make use of a 2D graphics and animation library with
  which we expect you are not familiar. We have provided Javadoc documentation
  for the library (augmented by JavaGrok) as well as English language
  descriptions of the tasks you are to perform. You will likely need to refer
  to the library documentation to correctly complete these tasks. We have also
  provided source to the library to which you may refer if you find the
  documentation to be insufficient for completing your tasks. </p>

<p><b>Checklist</b><br/> We have also provided a checklist on which we request
  that you record your experiences while completing these programming tasks.
  The checklist is meant to give us some quantitative feedback on how
  frequently you find the documentation augmentations to be useful, as well as
  how frequently you find that you need to refer to the library source code
  because the Javadoc and annotations do not provide sufficient information.
  Please try to update the checklist as you proceed through the tasks. </p>

<p> <a href="checklist.html">Checklist</a> (You will probably find it helpful to
  print out the checklist so that you can write on it during the experiment.)

<h3>Tasks and Build System</h3>

<p><b>Task Source Files</b><br/> Each task has an associated source file in
  which the code for that task should be placed. For example, code for task 1
  should be added to <code>src/experiment/Task1.java</code>. Comments in each
  task source file describe the goal of the task and provide indications of
  which classes from the graphics library will be useful in completing the
  task. </p>

<p><b>Build System</b><br/> A build system has been provided for compiling and
  running the tasks. The ant build tool is used to compile and run the tasks. A
  separate target exists to compile and run each task. If you invoke the build
  system from the command line, you would do so as follows: </p>

<blockquote><pre>
% ant task1
</pre></blockquote>

<p> You may opt instead to use a development environment such as
  Eclipse. <code>.project</code> and <code>.classpath</code> files have been
  provided that should allow you to simply import the experiment directory
  directly into Eclipse and write and execute the tasks from there.  Using any
  other IDE is also fine. </p>

<p><b>Javadoc documentation</b><br/> The Javadoc documentation for the graphics
  library is available here: </p>

<h3>Submitting Results</h3>

Please be sure to fill out this
<a href="questionnaire.html">questionnaire</a> once you have completed the
experiment, and hand in both the checklist and the questionnaire.
