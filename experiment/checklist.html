<h1>JavaGrok Experiment Checklist</h1>

<p> As you work, we anticipate that you will need to refer to the documentation
of the graphics library to complete your tasks. We have also provided the
source code to the graphics library if you find that the documentation does not
suffice in answering your questions. We ask that you please try the
documentation first, before inspecting the library source code. </p>

<p> We would like you to make a note whenever certain events take place.
Specifically: </p>

<ul>
<li> When you have a question about how to proceed with a task and you are able
  to answer that question to your satisfaction by referring to the graphics
  library documentation. </li>
<li> When you have a question about how to proceed with a task and you are able
  to answer that question to your satisfaction by referring to the graphics
  library source code. </li>
<li> When you have a question about how to proceed with a task and you are
  unable to answer the question by any means. </li>
<li> When the graphics library's behavior surprises you based on the
  documentation you have read. </li>
</ul>

<p> We have provided a space below for each of these categories. Any
unambiguous method of counting works fine; we suggest using ticks or hash
marks. Please tell whoever is helping you through the study when you start
working, and when you finish. When you are done, there is a short survey about
your experiences and feelings as you completed the test tasks. </p>

<tr><td class="box">Referred to Graphics Library Documentation</td></tr>
<tr><td class="box">Referred to Graphics Library Source</td></tr>
<tr><td class="box">Unable to Answer Question</td></tr>
<tr><td class="box">Was Surprised by Library Behavior</td></tr>

<p> If a question is answered by multiple means, please place a check in all
  sections that apply. </p>
