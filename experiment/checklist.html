<h1>JavaGrok Experiment Checklist</h1>

<p> As you work, we anticipate that you will need to refer to the existing
source code to complete your tasks. When you inspect the source code to answer
a question that arises during development, we ask that you note the way in
which the question was answered (or not). Specifically: </p>

<ul>
<li> When your question is answered by comments (either inline or Javadoc
  formatted). </li>
<li> When your question is answered by an annotation on a method or
  parameter. </li>
<li> When your question is answered by reading the code itself, either the
  bodies of methods or simply their signatures (method names and
  parameters). </li>
<li> When your question is answered in some other way (please write down a word
  or two describing the means by which your question was answered). </li>
<li> When your question was not answered by any means. </li>
</ul>

<p> We have provided a space below for each of these categories.  Any
unambiguous method of counting works fine; we suggest using ticks or hash
marks.  Please tell whoever is helping you through the study when you start
working, and when you finish.  When you are done, there is a short survey about
your experiences and feelings as you completed the test application. </p>

<tr><td class="box">Comments</td></tr>
<tr><td class="box">Annotations</td></tr>
<tr><td class="box">Code</td></tr>
<tr><td class="box">Other means</td></tr>
<tr><td class="box">Not answered</td></tr>

<p> If a question is answered by multiple means, please place a check in all
  sections that apply. </p>
