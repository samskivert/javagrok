	 * 
	 * Hello and welcome to the first task. I hope you 
	 * are all set and have received cookies and a drink to
	 * be ready to complete the tasks. :)
	 * 
	 * You're first task is to get comfortable with the framework.
	 * To do so you will be implementing the minimum function of
	 * Lisp. Minimum takes one or more integer arguments and returns
	 * the smallest.
	 * 
	 * examples: (min 3) --> 3
	 *           (min 3 1) --> 1
	 *           (min 3 -1 1) --> -1
	 *           
	 * Hint: See other functions and how they are implemented to
	 * get a clue what to do!
	 * 
	 * At the end you should be able to run: ant min
	 * Which will run the lisp/min.lisp program.
	 *
