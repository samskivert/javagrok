	 * TASK 2
	 * ======
	 * 
	 * Welcome to the second task. We hope you still have some
	 * cookies left... ;)
	 * 
	 * You're second task is to implement the 'cons' function
	 * which constructs a list. 
	 * 
	 * cons takes two arguments: a head, and a tail list.
	 * 
	 * examples: (cons 3 nil) --> (3)
	 *           (cons 3 (cons 1 nil)) --> (3 1)
	 *           (cons 2 (cons 3 (cons 1 nil))) --> (2 3 1)
	 * 
	 * At the end you should be able to run: ant cons
	 * which will run the lisp/cons.lisp program.
	 *
