/**
 * The controller class provides a basis for the separation of user interface
 * code into display code and control code. The display code lives in a panel
 * class (<code>javax.swing.JPanel</code> or something conceptually similar)
 * and the control code lives in an associated controller class.
 *
 * <p> The controller philosophy is thus: The panel class (and its UI
 * components) convert basic user interface actions into higher level actions
 * that more cleanly encapsulate the action desired by the user and they pass
 * those actions on to their controller. The controller then performs abstract
 * processing based on the users desires and the changing state of the
 * application and calls back to the panel to affect changes to the display.
 *
 * <p> Controllers also support the notion of scope. When a panel wishes to
 * post an action, it doesn't do it directly to the controller. Instead it does
 * it using a controller utility function called {@link #postAction}, which
 * searches up the user interface hierarchy looking for a component that
 * implements {@link ControllerProvider} which it will use to obtain the
 * controller "in scope" for that component. That controller is requested to
 * handle the action, but if it cannot handle the action, the next controller
 * up the chain is located and requested to process the action.
 *
 * <p> In this manner, a hierarchy of controllers (often just two: one
 * application wide and one for whatever particular mode the application is in
 * at the moment) can provide a set of services that are available to all user
 * interface elements in the entire application and in a way that doesn't
 * require tight connectedness between the UI elements and the controllers.

     * <p> For example, wiring a button up to a dispatcher would look like

     * the event, it should return true from this method to indicate that
     * processing should stop. If it cannot handle the event, it can return
     * false to indicate that the event should be propagated to the next
     * controller up the chain.
     *
     * <p> This method will be called on the AWT thread, so the controller can
     * safely manipulate user interface components while handling an action.
     * However, this means that action handling cannot block and should not
     * take an undue amount of time. If the controller needs to perform
     * complicated, lengthy processing it should do so with a separate thread,
     * for example via {@link com.samskivert.swing.util.TaskMaster}.
     *
     * <p> The default implementation of this method will reflect on the
     * controller class, looking for a method that matches the name of the
     * action event. For example, if the action was "exit" a method named
     * "exit" would be sought. A handler method must provide one of three
     * signatures: one accepting no arguments, one including only a reference
     * to the source object, or one including the source object and an extra
     * argument (which can be used only if the action event is an instance of
     * {@link CommandEvent}). For example:
     *
     * <pre>
     * public void cancelClicked (Object source);
     * public void textEntered (Object source, String text);
     * </pre>
     *
     * The arguments to the method can be as specific or as generic as desired
     * and reflection will perform the appropriate conversions at runtime. For
     * example, a method could be declared like so:
     *
     * <pre>
     * public void cancelClicked (JButton source);
     * </pre>
     *
     * One would have to ensure that the only action events generated with the
     * action command string "cancelClicked" were generated by JButton
     * instances if such a signature were used.
     *
     * @param action the action to be processed.
     *
     * @return true if the action was processed, false if it should be
     * propagated up to the next controller in scope.
