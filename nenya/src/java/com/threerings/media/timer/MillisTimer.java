/**
 * Implements the {@link MediaTimer} interface using {@link System#currentTimeMillis} to obtain
 * timing information.
 *
 * <p> <em>Note:</em> {@link System#currentTimeMillis} is notoriously inaccurate on different
 * platforms. See <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4486109.html">
 * bug report 4486109</a> for more information.
 *
 * <p> <em>Also note:</em> clock drift on Windows XP is especially pronounced and is exacerbated by
 * the fact that WinXP periodically resyncs the system clock with the hardware clock, causing
 * discontinuous jumps in the progression of time (usually backwards in time).
