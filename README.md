JavaGrok is a framework for collecting the results of numerous inference analyses on a code base
and expressing those as human readable documentation injected into standard Javadoc API
documentation.

It is currently a work in progress (being performed by some UW CS grad students for [CSE
503](http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/503/10wi/) a software engineering course). We
hope that the resulting tool will be generally useful and some day have a life of its own, helping
developers to understand poorly or undocumented APIs and helping thoughtful developers to provide
additional information in the documentation supplied with their own libraries.

## Planned Analyses

 * Nullability
 * Leaking & capturing
 * Mutability
 * Preconditions/Dependence

More information will be made available as the project takes shape.
