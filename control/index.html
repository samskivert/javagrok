<h2>JavaGrok Experiment</h2>

<p> Hello! Thanks for participating in our experimental evaluation. We've
provided these instructions to give you a bit of background and guide you
through the programming tasks we'd like you to complete. </p>

<h3>Experiment Procedure</h3>

<p> Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to complete a series of
  programming tasks that make use of a 2D graphics and animation library with
  which we expect you are not familiar. We have provided Javadoc documentation
  for the library as well as English language descriptions of the tasks you are
  to perform. You will likely need to refer to the library documentation to
  correctly complete these tasks. We have also provided source to the library
  to which you may refer if you find the documentation to be insufficient for
  completing your tasks. </p>

<p><b>Checklist</b><br/> We have also provided a checklist on which we request
  that you record your experiences while completing these programming tasks.
  The checklist is meant to give us some quantitative feedback on how
  frequently you find the documentation to be useful, as well as how frequently
  you find that you need to refer to the library source code because the
  Javadoc does not provide sufficient information. Please try to update the
  checklist as you proceed through the tasks. </p>

<p> <a href="checklist.html">Checklist</a> (You will probably find it helpful to
  print out the checklist so that you can write on it during the experiment.)

<h3>Tasks and Build System</h3>

<p><b>Task Source Files</b><br/> Each task has an associated source file in
  which the code for that task should be placed. For example, code for task 1
  should be added to <code>src/experiment/Task1.java</code>. Comments in each
  task source file describe the goal of the task and provide indications of
  which classes from the graphics library will be useful in completing the
  task. </p>

<p><b>Build System</b><br/> A build system has been provided for compiling and
  running the tasks. The ant build tool is used to compile and run the tasks. A
  separate target exists to compile and run each task. If you invoke the build
  system from the command line, you would do so as follows: </p>

<blockquote><pre>
% ant task1
</pre></blockquote>

<p> You may opt instead to use a development environment such as
  Eclipse. <code>.project</code> and <code>.classpath</code> files have been
  provided that should allow you to simply import the experiment directory
  directly into Eclipse and write and execute the tasks from there.  Using any
  other IDE is also fine. </p>

<p><b>Javadoc documentation</b><br/> The Javadoc documentation for the graphics
  library is available here: </p>

<h3>Submitting Results</h3>

Please be sure to fill out this
<a href="questionnaire.html">questionnaire</a> once you have completed the
experiment, and hand in both the checklist and the questionnaire.
