JDK 1.7 Compiler
----------------

The main thing you need to compile JavaGrok is the JDK 1.7 Java compiler. This
can be most easily obtained from the OpenJDK project as described on this
webpage: http://openjdk.java.net/groups/compiler/

The short version is as follows:

% hg clone http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7/tl/langtools
% cd langtools/make
% [edit build.properties; set boot.java.home a JDK 1.6 installation]
% ant build-all-tools

You should now have a compiled version of javac, javadoc and some other bits in
langtools/dist.

JavaGrok Build Config
---------------------

Now copy javagrok/build.properties.dist to javagrok/build.properties and set
javac.home to <somepath>/langtools/dist.

You should now be able to build and run javagrok. Invoke "ant -p" to learn
about the useful ant targets:

% ant -p
Buildfile: build.xml

Main targets:

 all        Cleans and rebuilds everything including documentation.
 clean      Cleans out build results.
 compile    Compiles the code.
 dist       Compiles the code and builds our jar file.
 distclean  Completely removes build result directory.
 dogfood    Runs the analyses on the JavaGrok source.
 javadoc    Generates javadoc documentation.
 tests      Compiles and runs the unit tests.
Default target: compile
